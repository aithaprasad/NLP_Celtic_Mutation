# NLP_Celtic_Mutation
We will work with Irish language data in this challenge, where there are four different mutations which we tag as S, U, H, and T (and we introduce a fifth label N for words that are not mutated like “an” above)
The challenge is then to take a text where the mutations have been removed (e.g. bhean → bean) and predict the correct mutation labels
